## Objective
To configure a policy within the Symantec Enforce Console that detects, monitors, and prevents the unauthorized transfer of Credit Card Numbers (CCN) across Endpoint (USB/Printing) and Network (Email) channels.

---

## 1. Detection Logic
We utilize **Content-Aware Detection** using built-in Symantec Data Identifiers.

* **Identifier:** Credit Card Numbers (Includes Visa, MC, Amex, Discover).
* **Validation:** Uses the **Luhn Check** algorithm to reduce false positives by verifying the mathematical validity of the number string.
* **Thresholds:**
    * **Low Severity:** 1–5 matches (Monitor & Audit).
    * **High Severity:** 6+ matches (Block & Notify).

## 2. Policy Configuration Steps

### Step A: Define the Condition
1.  Navigate to **Manage > Policies > New Policy**.
2.  Select **Add Rule** -> **Content Matches Data Identifier**.
3.  Choose **Credit Card Numbers**.
4.  Set the "Count" to `1` or more.

### Step B: Configure Response Rules
We want different actions based on the "state" of the data:

| Channel | Action | User Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Endpoint (USB)** | **Block** | Desktop Popup with Justification required. |
| **Network (Email)** | **Quarantine** | Sender receives a "Message Delayed" notification. |
| **Cloud (SaaS)** | **Remove Sharing** | File permissions reset to "Private". |

## 3. Deployment
The policy is assigned to the **Global Policy Group** and pushed to the **Detection Servers**. 

> **Note:** Initial deployment is set to **Monitor Only** for 7 days to identify legitimate business processes that may trigger the rule (Tuning Phase).
